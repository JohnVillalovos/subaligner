00:12.440 --> 00:14.955
I've spent nearly two decades

00:14.979 --> 00:18.532
observing what makes people luckier than others

00:18.556 --> 00:22.119
and trying to help people increase their luck.

00:22.675 --> 00:25.567
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

00:25.591 --> 00:29.140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

00:29.164 --> 00:32.797
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

00:33.846 --> 00:35.136
So what is luck?

00:35.160 --> 00:41.200
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

00:42.295 --> 00:43.662
Apparently.

00:43.686 --> 00:45.321
That's the operative word.

00:46.353 --> 00:48.362
It looks like it's chance

00:48.386 --> 00:53.544
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

00:53.568 --> 00:56.561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

00:56.585 --> 00:59.918
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

00:59.942 --> 01:01.696
isolated and dramatic.

01:02.249 --> 01:04.635
It's much more like the wind,

01:04.659 --> 01:06.225
blowing constantly.

01:06.249 --> 01:07.818
Sometimes it's calm,

01:07.842 --> 01:09.943
and sometimes it blows in gusts,

01:09.967 --> 01:14.192
and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.

01:14.216 --> 01:16.689
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

01:17.616 --> 01:20.195
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.615
So I'm going to share three things with you

01:23.639 --> 01:28.823
that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.

01:29.651 --> 01:31.406
The first thing you want to do

01:31.430 --> 01:33.935
is to change your relationship with yourself.

01:33.959 --> 01:38.071
Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

01:38.095 --> 01:41.491
Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.

01:42.459 --> 01:45.698
We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk

01:45.722 --> 01:46.880
or ride a bike

01:46.904 --> 01:48.848
or even quantum mechanics. Right?

01:48.872 --> 01:51.796
We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike

01:51.820 --> 01:53.603
to, next week, someone who does.

01:53.627 --> 01:56.181
And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone

01:56.205 --> 01:58.008
and take some risks.

01:58.032 --> 02:00.151
The problem is, as we get older,

02:00.175 --> 02:02.056
we rarely do this.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.327
We sort of lock down the sense of who we are

02:04.351 --> 02:06.149
and don't stretch anymore.

02:06.173 --> 02:07.771
Now, with my students,

02:07.795 --> 02:10.651
I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement

02:10.675 --> 02:13.183
to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.

02:13.787 --> 02:14.952
How do I do this?

02:14.976 --> 02:18.848
Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.652
Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class

02:21.676 --> 02:24.706
where they map out what risks they're willing to take.

02:24.730 --> 02:27.634
And it becomes clear very quickly to them

02:27.658 --> 02:29.734
that risk-taking is not binary.

02:30.242 --> 02:33.893
There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks

02:33.917 --> 02:37.905
and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.

02:37.929 --> 02:41.714
And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,

02:41.738 --> 02:45.040
and they quickly realize that they're all really different.

02:46.006 --> 02:48.562
I then encourage them to stretch,

02:48.586 --> 02:51.475
to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.

02:51.499 --> 02:54.854
For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk

02:54.878 --> 02:57.942
and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;

02:57.966 --> 03:02.465
or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;

03:02.489 --> 03:04.220
or an emotional risk,

03:04.244 --> 03:07.185
maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.

03:08.306 --> 03:10.751
I do this myself all the time.

03:11.286 --> 03:13.691
About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,

03:13.715 --> 03:16.476
early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.

03:16.500 --> 03:22.222
And normally, I would just put on my headphones

03:22.246 --> 03:24.177
and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,

03:24.201 --> 03:25.960
but I decided to take a little risk,

03:25.984 --> 03:28.842
and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.

03:28.866 --> 03:32.073
I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.

03:33.695 --> 03:34.856
Interesting.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.128
We ended up having a fascinating conversation.

03:37.152 --> 03:39.945
I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.160
So about three quarters of the way through the flight,

03:43.184 --> 03:44.965
I decided to take another risk,

03:44.989 --> 03:48.949
and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal

03:48.973 --> 03:52.949
I put together for something I was doing in my class.

03:52.973 --> 03:54.697
And he was very polite, he read it,

03:54.721 --> 03:57.483
and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,

03:57.507 --> 03:59.174
but thank you so much for sharing."

03:59.198 --> 04:01.231
It's OK. That risk didn't work out.

04:01.745 --> 04:03.021
I shut my laptop.

04:03.045 --> 04:06.046
At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.

04:07.594 --> 04:10.006
A couple of months later, I reached out to him,

04:10.030 --> 04:12.672
and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?

04:12.696 --> 04:15.450
I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,

04:15.474 --> 04:16.783
the future of publishing."

04:16.807 --> 04:18.665
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

04:18.689 --> 04:21.024
So he came to my class. We had a great experience.

04:21.048 --> 04:23.147
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

04:23.171 --> 04:25.837
This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips

04:25.861 --> 04:28.099
from another project my students had done.

04:28.948 --> 04:31.514
He was so intrigued

04:31.538 --> 04:33.720
by one of the projects the students had done,

04:33.744 --> 04:35.718
he thought there might be a book in it,

04:35.742 --> 04:37.885
and he wanted to meet those students.

04:38.224 --> 04:40.407
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.

04:41.456 --> 04:44.481
I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,

04:44.505 --> 04:45.656
but OK, it's all right.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.187
So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford

04:49.211 --> 04:52.655
and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.

04:53.487 --> 04:55.283
And one of his editors said to me,

04:55.307 --> 04:58.108
"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"

04:58.918 --> 05:00.735
I said, "Funny you should ask."

05:00.759 --> 05:03.854
And I pulled out the exact same proposal

05:03.878 --> 05:07.242
that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.686
Within two weeks, I had a contract,

05:09.710 --> 05:13.591
and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.

05:16.225 --> 05:18.257
Now, you might say,

05:18.281 --> 05:19.630
"Oh, you're so lucky."

05:19.654 --> 05:20.925
But of course I was lucky,

05:20.949 --> 05:25.273
but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,

05:25.297 --> 05:27.567
starting with saying hello.

05:27.591 --> 05:29.980
And anyone can do this,

05:30.004 --> 05:31.767
no matter where you are in your life,

05:31.791 --> 05:33.651
no matter where you are in the world --

05:33.675 --> 05:36.961
even if you think you're the most unlucky person,

05:36.985 --> 05:41.274
you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

05:41.298 --> 05:43.627
You start building a sail to capture luck.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.348
The second thing you want to do

05:46.372 --> 05:49.081
is to change your relationship with other people.

05:49.105 --> 05:54.471
You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey

05:54.495 --> 05:58.376
is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.011
And if you don't show appreciation,

06:01.035 --> 06:03.320
not only are you not closing the loop,

06:03.344 --> 06:05.082
but you're missing an opportunity.

06:06.392 --> 06:08.424
When someone does something for you,

06:08.448 --> 06:09.710
they're taking that time

06:09.734 --> 06:12.934
that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,

06:12.958 --> 06:15.439
and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.

06:16.492 --> 06:20.761
Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,

06:20.785 --> 06:22.882
and they are very competitive to get into,

06:22.906 --> 06:26.147
and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,

06:26.171 --> 06:29.172
I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.

06:29.196 --> 06:32.376
Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.003
Some of them send notes

06:34.027 --> 06:37.475
saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?

06:37.499 --> 06:38.810
And every once in a while,

06:38.834 --> 06:42.173
someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.596
This happened about seven years ago.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.349
A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,

06:47.373 --> 06:50.628
"I know I've been rejected from this program twice,

06:50.652 --> 06:52.752
but I want to thank you for the opportunity.

06:52.776 --> 06:55.423
I learned so much through the process of applying."

06:56.205 --> 07:00.080
I was so taken by the graciousness of his message

07:00.104 --> 07:02.190
that I invited him to come and meet me.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.001
And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea

07:05.025 --> 07:07.048
for an independent study project together.

07:08.072 --> 07:10.041
He was on the football team at Stanford,

07:10.065 --> 07:13.994
and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.

07:14.366 --> 07:17.985
We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,

07:18.009 --> 07:20.414
and he took the project that he started working on

07:20.438 --> 07:21.748
in the independent study

07:21.772 --> 07:26.252
and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,

07:26.276 --> 07:29.247
where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds

07:29.271 --> 07:32.077
how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.

07:33.149 --> 07:35.998
Now, the important thing about this story

07:36.022 --> 07:39.142
is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck

07:39.166 --> 07:41.378
as a result of his thank-you note.

07:41.402 --> 07:44.917
But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.

07:46.145 --> 07:48.194
Over the course of the last couple of years,

07:48.218 --> 07:51.226
I've come up with some tactics for my own life

07:51.250 --> 07:53.527
to help me really foster appreciation.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.655
My favorite is that at the end of every single day,

07:57.679 --> 08:01.425
I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,

08:01.449 --> 08:04.505
and I send thank-you notes to every single person.

08:04.529 --> 08:06.703
It only takes a few minutes,

08:06.727 --> 08:08.506
but at the end of every day,

08:08.530 --> 08:11.799
I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,

08:11.823 --> 08:14.343
and I promise you it has increased my luck.

08:15.207 --> 08:18.806
So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.296
Second, you need to show appreciation.

08:21.320 --> 08:25.216
And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.

08:26.210 --> 08:29.518
Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.298
"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."

08:32.322 --> 08:35.306
But it's actually much more nuanced.

08:36.031 --> 08:37.878
Ideas are neither good or bad.

08:37.902 --> 08:42.708
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.238
One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity

08:47.262 --> 08:51.324
is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas

08:51.348 --> 08:54.503
through the lens of possibilities.

08:55.157 --> 08:57.294
So I give them a challenge:

08:57.318 --> 09:00.543
to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.994
They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant

09:04.018 --> 09:06.587
and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

09:06.611 --> 09:10.070
So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop

09:10.094 --> 09:11.629
with a beautiful sunset,

09:11.653 --> 09:14.549
or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.

09:14.573 --> 09:19.359
And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,

09:19.383 --> 09:23.627
or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,

09:23.651 --> 09:27.073
or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.

09:28.445 --> 09:30.565
So they hand all the ideas to me,

09:30.589 --> 09:32.832
I read the great ideas out loud,

09:32.856 --> 09:34.921
and then I rip them up and throw them away.

09:36.413 --> 09:39.555
I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.

09:40.159 --> 09:44.722
Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,

09:44.746 --> 09:47.563
and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.

09:48.984 --> 09:50.179
Here's what happens.

09:50.904 --> 09:55.812
Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."

09:55.836 --> 10:00.478
And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.

10:00.502 --> 10:03.789
So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?

10:03.813 --> 10:07.973
Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants

10:07.997 --> 10:10.301
that was going to get thrown out,

10:10.325 --> 10:12.905
and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,

10:12.929 --> 10:14.080
with all the leftovers.

10:14.104 --> 10:15.261
Pretty cool?

10:15.285 --> 10:18.233
Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?

10:18.689 --> 10:22.408
Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground

10:22.432 --> 10:26.527
for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.298
And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?

10:29.322 --> 10:31.452
It turns into a sushi bar

10:31.476 --> 10:34.559
with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.

10:35.922 --> 10:39.010
If you look around at the companies,

10:39.034 --> 10:42.081
the ventures that are really innovative around you,

10:42.105 --> 10:45.731
the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,

10:45.755 --> 10:47.025
well, you know what?

10:47.049 --> 10:49.930
They all started out as crazy ideas.

10:49.954 --> 10:52.683
They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,

10:52.707 --> 10:55.834
most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."

10:58.095 --> 11:03.863
So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,

11:03.887 --> 11:06.172
and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt

11:06.196 --> 11:09.156
that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.

11:10.108 --> 11:14.060
But the winds of luck are always there,

11:14.084 --> 11:17.139
and if you're willing to take some risks,

11:17.163 --> 11:20.671
if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation

11:20.695 --> 11:25.116
and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,

11:25.140 --> 11:26.909
through the lens of possibilities,

11:26.933 --> 11:31.335
(SOUND EFFECT)

11:31.692 --> 11:32.843
(SOUND EFFECT)
