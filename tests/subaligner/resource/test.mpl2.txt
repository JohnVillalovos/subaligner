[124][149] I've spent nearly two decades
[149][185] observing what makes people luckier than others
[185][221] and trying to help people increase their luck.
[226][255] You see, I teach entrepreneurship,
[255][291] and we all know that most new ventures fail,
[291][327] and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.
[338][351] So what is luck?
[351][412] Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
[422][436] Apparently.
[436][453] That's the operative word.
[463][483] It looks like it's chance
[483][535] because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
[535][565] But I've realized, by watching so long,
[565][599] that luck is rarely a lightning strike,
[599][616] isolated and dramatic.
[622][646] It's much more like the wind,
[646][662] blowing constantly.
[662][678] Sometimes it's calm,
[678][699] and sometimes it blows in gusts,
[699][741] and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.
[742][766] So how do you catch the winds of luck?
[776][801] It's easy, but it's not obvious.
[806][836] So I'm going to share three things with you
[836][888] that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.
[896][914] The first thing you want to do
[914][939] is to change your relationship with yourself.
[939][980] Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
[980][1014] Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.
[1024][1056] We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk
[1057][1068] or ride a bike
[1069][1088] or even quantum mechanics. Right?
[1088][1117] We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike
[1118][1136] to, next week, someone who does.
[1136][1161] And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone
[1162][1180] and take some risks.
[1180][1201] The problem is, as we get older,
[1201][1220] we rarely do this.
[1220][1243] We sort of lock down the sense of who we are
[1243][1261] and don't stretch anymore.
[1261][1277] Now, with my students,
[1277][1306] I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement
[1306][1331] to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.
[1337][1349] How do I do this?
[1349][1388] Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.
[1388][1416] Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class
[1416][1447] where they map out what risks they're willing to take.
[1447][1476] And it becomes clear very quickly to them
[1476][1497] that risk-taking is not binary.
[1502][1538] There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks
[1539][1579] and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.
[1579][1617] And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,
[1617][1650] and they quickly realize that they're all really different.
[1660][1685] I then encourage them to stretch,
[1685][1714] to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.
[1714][1748] For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk
[1748][1779] and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;
[1779][1824] or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;
[1824][1842] or an emotional risk,
[1842][1871] maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.
[1883][1907] I do this myself all the time.
[1912][1936] About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,
[1937][1964] early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.
[1965][2022] And normally, I would just put on my headphones
[2022][2041] and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,
[2042][2059] but I decided to take a little risk,
[2059][2088] and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.
[2088][2120] I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.
[2136][2148] Interesting.
[2148][2171] We ended up having a fascinating conversation.
[2171][2199] I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.
[2199][2231] So about three quarters of the way through the flight,
[2231][2249] I decided to take another risk,
[2249][2289] and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal
[2289][2329] I put together for something I was doing in my class.
[2329][2346] And he was very polite, he read it,
[2347][2374] and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,
[2375][2391] but thank you so much for sharing."
[2391][2412] It's OK. That risk didn't work out.
[2417][2430] I shut my laptop.
[2430][2460] At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.
[2475][2500] A couple of months later, I reached out to him,
[2500][2526] and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?
[2526][2554] I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,
[2554][2567] the future of publishing."
[2568][2586] And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."
[2586][2610] So he came to my class. We had a great experience.
[2610][2631] A few months later, I wrote to him again.
[2631][2658] This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips
[2658][2680] from another project my students had done.
[2689][2715] He was so intrigued
[2715][2737] by one of the projects the students had done,
[2737][2757] he thought there might be a book in it,
[2757][2778] and he wanted to meet those students.
[2782][2804] I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.
[2814][2844] I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,
[2845][2856] but OK, it's all right.
[2856][2891] So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford
[2892][2926] and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.
[2934][2952] And one of his editors said to me,
[2953][2981] "Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"
[2989][3007] I said, "Funny you should ask."
[3007][3038] And I pulled out the exact same proposal
[3038][3072] that I had showed his boss a year earlier.
[3072][3096] Within two weeks, I had a contract,
[3097][3135] and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.
[3162][3182] Now, you might say,
[3182][3196] "Oh, you're so lucky."
[3196][3209] But of course I was lucky,
[3209][3252] but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,
[3252][3275] starting with saying hello.
[3275][3299] And anyone can do this,
[3300][3317] no matter where you are in your life,
[3317][3336] no matter where you are in the world --
[3336][3369] even if you think you're the most unlucky person,
[3369][3412] you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
[3412][3436] You start building a sail to capture luck.
[3446][3463] The second thing you want to do
[3463][3490] is to change your relationship with other people.
[3491][3544] You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey
[3544][3583] is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.
[3584][3610] And if you don't show appreciation,
[3610][3633] not only are you not closing the loop,
[3633][3650] but you're missing an opportunity.
[3663][3684] When someone does something for you,
[3684][3697] they're taking that time
[3697][3729] that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,
[3729][3754] and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.
[3764][3807] Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,
[3807][3828] and they are very competitive to get into,
[3829][3861] and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,
[3861][3891] I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.
[3891][3923] Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.
[3924][3940] Some of them send notes
[3940][3974] saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?
[3974][3988] And every once in a while,
[3988][4021] someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.
[4028][4045] This happened about seven years ago.
[4046][4073] A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,
[4073][4106] "I know I've been rejected from this program twice,
[4106][4127] but I want to thank you for the opportunity.
[4127][4154] I learned so much through the process of applying."
[4162][4200] I was so taken by the graciousness of his message
[4201][4221] that I invited him to come and meet me.
[4222][4250] And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea
[4250][4270] for an independent study project together.
[4280][4300] He was on the football team at Stanford,
[4300][4339] and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.
[4343][4379] We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,
[4380][4404] and he took the project that he started working on
[4404][4417] in the independent study
[4417][4462] and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,
[4462][4492] where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds
[4492][4520] how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.
[4531][4559] Now, the important thing about this story
[4560][4591] is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck
[4591][4613] as a result of his thank-you note.
[4614][4649] But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.
[4661][4681] Over the course of the last couple of years,
[4682][4712] I've come up with some tactics for my own life
[4712][4735] to help me really foster appreciation.
[4741][4776] My favorite is that at the end of every single day,
[4776][4814] I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,
[4814][4845] and I send thank-you notes to every single person.
[4845][4867] It only takes a few minutes,
[4867][4885] but at the end of every day,
[4885][4917] I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,
[4918][4943] and I promise you it has increased my luck.
[4952][4988] So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.
[4988][5012] Second, you need to show appreciation.
[5013][5052] And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.
[5062][5095] Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.
[5095][5122] "That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."
[5123][5153] But it's actually much more nuanced.
[5160][5178] Ideas are neither good or bad.
[5179][5227] And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.
[5240][5272] One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity
[5272][5313] is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas
[5313][5345] through the lens of possibilities.
[5351][5372] So I give them a challenge:
[5373][5405] to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.
[5410][5439] They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant
[5440][5465] and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.
[5466][5500] So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop
[5500][5516] with a beautiful sunset,
[5516][5545] or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.
[5545][5593] And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,
[5593][5636] or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,
[5636][5670] or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.
[5684][5705] So they hand all the ideas to me,
[5705][5728] I read the great ideas out loud,
[5728][5749] and then I rip them up and throw them away.
[5764][5795] I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.
[5801][5847] Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,
[5847][5875] and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.
[5889][5901] Here's what happens.
[5909][5958] Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."
[5958][6004] And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.
[6005][6037] So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?
[6038][6079] Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants
[6079][6103] that was going to get thrown out,
[6103][6129] and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,
[6129][6140] with all the leftovers.
[6141][6152] Pretty cool?
[6152][6182] Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?
[6186][6224] Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground
[6224][6265] for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.
[6273][6292] And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?
[6293][6314] It turns into a sushi bar
[6314][6345] with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.
[6359][6390] If you look around at the companies,
[6390][6420] the ventures that are really innovative around you,
[6421][6457] the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,
[6457][6470] well, you know what?
[6470][6499] They all started out as crazy ideas.
[6499][6526] They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,
[6527][6558] most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."
[6580][6638] So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,
[6638][6661] and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt
[6661][6691] that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.
[6701][6740] But the winds of luck are always there,
[6740][6771] and if you're willing to take some risks,
[6771][6806] if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation
[6806][6851] and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,
[6851][6869] through the lens of possibilities,
[6869][6913] (SOUND EFFECT)
[6916][6928] (SOUND EFFECT)
