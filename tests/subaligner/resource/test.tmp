00:00:12:I've spent nearly two decades
00:00:14:observing what makes people luckier than others
00:00:18:and trying to help people increase their luck.
00:00:22:You see, I teach entrepreneurship,
00:00:25:and we all know that most new ventures fail,
00:00:29:and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.
00:00:33:So what is luck?
00:00:35:Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
00:00:42:Apparently.
00:00:43:That's the operative word.
00:00:46:It looks like it's chance
00:00:48:because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
00:00:53:But I've realized, by watching so long,
00:00:56:that luck is rarely a lightning strike,
00:00:59:isolated and dramatic.
00:01:02:It's much more like the wind,
00:01:04:blowing constantly.
00:01:06:Sometimes it's calm,
00:01:07:and sometimes it blows in gusts,
00:01:09:and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.
00:01:14:So how do you catch the winds of luck?
00:01:17:It's easy, but it's not obvious.
00:01:20:So I'm going to share three things with you
00:01:23:that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.
00:01:29:The first thing you want to do
00:01:31:is to change your relationship with yourself.
00:01:33:Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
00:01:38:Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.
00:01:42:We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk
00:01:45:or ride a bike
00:01:46:or even quantum mechanics. Right?
00:01:48:We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike
00:01:51:to, next week, someone who does.
00:01:53:And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone
00:01:56:and take some risks.
00:01:58:The problem is, as we get older,
00:02:00:we rarely do this.
00:02:02:We sort of lock down the sense of who we are
00:02:04:and don't stretch anymore.
00:02:06:Now, with my students,
00:02:07:I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement
00:02:10:to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.
00:02:13:How do I do this?
00:02:14:Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.
00:02:18:Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class
00:02:21:where they map out what risks they're willing to take.
00:02:24:And it becomes clear very quickly to them
00:02:27:that risk-taking is not binary.
00:02:30:There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks
00:02:33:and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.
00:02:37:And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,
00:02:41:and they quickly realize that they're all really different.
00:02:46:I then encourage them to stretch,
00:02:48:to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.
00:02:51:For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk
00:02:54:and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;
00:02:57:or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;
00:03:02:or an emotional risk,
00:03:04:maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.
00:03:08:I do this myself all the time.
00:03:11:About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,
00:03:13:early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.
00:03:16:And normally, I would just put on my headphones
00:03:22:and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,
00:03:24:but I decided to take a little risk,
00:03:25:and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.
00:03:28:I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.
00:03:33:Interesting.
00:03:34:We ended up having a fascinating conversation.
00:03:37:I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.
00:03:39:So about three quarters of the way through the flight,
00:03:43:I decided to take another risk,
00:03:44:and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal
00:03:48:I put together for something I was doing in my class.
00:03:52:And he was very polite, he read it,
00:03:54:and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,
00:03:57:but thank you so much for sharing."
00:03:59:It's OK. That risk didn't work out.
00:04:01:I shut my laptop.
00:04:03:At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.
00:04:07:A couple of months later, I reached out to him,
00:04:10:and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?
00:04:12:I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,
00:04:15:the future of publishing."
00:04:16:And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."
00:04:18:So he came to my class. We had a great experience.
00:04:21:A few months later, I wrote to him again.
00:04:23:This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips
00:04:25:from another project my students had done.
00:04:28:He was so intrigued
00:04:31:by one of the projects the students had done,
00:04:33:he thought there might be a book in it,
00:04:35:and he wanted to meet those students.
00:04:38:I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.
00:04:41:I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,
00:04:44:but OK, it's all right.
00:04:45:So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford
00:04:49:and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.
00:04:53:And one of his editors said to me,
00:04:55:"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"
00:04:58:I said, "Funny you should ask."
00:05:00:And I pulled out the exact same proposal
00:05:03:that I had showed his boss a year earlier.
00:05:07:Within two weeks, I had a contract,
00:05:09:and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.
00:05:16:Now, you might say,
00:05:18:"Oh, you're so lucky."
00:05:19:But of course I was lucky,
00:05:20:but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,
00:05:25:starting with saying hello.
00:05:27:And anyone can do this,
00:05:30:no matter where you are in your life,
00:05:31:no matter where you are in the world --
00:05:33:even if you think you're the most unlucky person,
00:05:36:you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
00:05:41:You start building a sail to capture luck.
00:05:44:The second thing you want to do
00:05:46:is to change your relationship with other people.
00:05:49:You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey
00:05:54:is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.
00:05:58:And if you don't show appreciation,
00:06:01:not only are you not closing the loop,
00:06:03:but you're missing an opportunity.
00:06:06:When someone does something for you,
00:06:08:they're taking that time
00:06:09:that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,
00:06:12:and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.
00:06:16:Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,
00:06:20:and they are very competitive to get into,
00:06:22:and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,
00:06:26:I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.
00:06:29:Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.
00:06:32:Some of them send notes
00:06:34:saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?
00:06:37:And every once in a while,
00:06:38:someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.
00:06:42:This happened about seven years ago.
00:06:44:A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,
00:06:47:"I know I've been rejected from this program twice,
00:06:50:but I want to thank you for the opportunity.
00:06:52:I learned so much through the process of applying."
00:06:56:I was so taken by the graciousness of his message
00:07:00:that I invited him to come and meet me.
00:07:02:And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea
00:07:05:for an independent study project together.
00:07:08:He was on the football team at Stanford,
00:07:10:and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.
00:07:14:We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,
00:07:18:and he took the project that he started working on
00:07:20:in the independent study
00:07:21:and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,
00:07:26:where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds
00:07:29:how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.
00:07:33:Now, the important thing about this story
00:07:36:is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck
00:07:39:as a result of his thank-you note.
00:07:41:But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.
00:07:46:Over the course of the last couple of years,
00:07:48:I've come up with some tactics for my own life
00:07:51:to help me really foster appreciation.
00:07:54:My favorite is that at the end of every single day,
00:07:57:I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,
00:08:01:and I send thank-you notes to every single person.
00:08:04:It only takes a few minutes,
00:08:06:but at the end of every day,
00:08:08:I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,
00:08:11:and I promise you it has increased my luck.
00:08:15:So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.
00:08:18:Second, you need to show appreciation.
00:08:21:And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.
00:08:26:Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.
00:08:29:"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."
00:08:32:But it's actually much more nuanced.
00:08:36:Ideas are neither good or bad.
00:08:37:And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.
00:08:44:One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity
00:08:47:is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas
00:08:51:through the lens of possibilities.
00:08:55:So I give them a challenge:
00:08:57:to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.
00:09:01:They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant
00:09:04:and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.
00:09:06:So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop
00:09:10:with a beautiful sunset,
00:09:11:or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.
00:09:14:And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,
00:09:19:or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,
00:09:23:or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.
00:09:28:So they hand all the ideas to me,
00:09:30:I read the great ideas out loud,
00:09:32:and then I rip them up and throw them away.
00:09:36:I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.
00:09:40:Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,
00:09:44:and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.
00:09:48:Here's what happens.
00:09:50:Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."
00:09:55:And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.
00:10:00:So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?
00:10:03:Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants
00:10:07:that was going to get thrown out,
00:10:10:and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,
00:10:12:with all the leftovers.
00:10:14:Pretty cool?
00:10:15:Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?
00:10:18:Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground
00:10:22:for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.
00:10:27:And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?
00:10:29:It turns into a sushi bar
00:10:31:with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.
00:10:35:If you look around at the companies,
00:10:39:the ventures that are really innovative around you,
00:10:42:the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,
00:10:45:well, you know what?
00:10:47:They all started out as crazy ideas.
00:10:49:They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,
00:10:52:most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."
00:10:58:So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,
00:11:03:and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt
00:11:06:that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.
00:11:10:But the winds of luck are always there,
00:11:14:and if you're willing to take some risks,
00:11:17:if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation
00:11:20:and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,
00:11:25:through the lens of possibilities,
00:11:26:(SOUND EFFECT)
00:11:31:(SOUND EFFECT)
