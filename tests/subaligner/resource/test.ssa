Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:12.44,0:00:14.95,Default,,0,0,0,,I've spent nearly two decades
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:14.97,0:00:18.53,Default,,0,0,0,,observing what makes people luckier than others
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:18.55,0:00:22.11,Default,,0,0,0,,and trying to help people increase their luck.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:22.67,0:00:25.56,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, I teach entrepreneurship,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:25.59,0:00:29.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and we all know that most new ventures fail,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:29.16,0:00:32.79,Default,,0,0,0,,and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:33.84,0:00:35.13,Default,,0,0,0,,So what is luck?
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:35.16,0:00:41.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:42.29,0:00:43.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Apparently.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:43.68,0:00:45.32,Default,,0,0,0,,That's the operative word.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:46.35,0:00:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,It looks like it's chance
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:48.38,0:00:53.54,Default,,0,0,0,,because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:53.56,0:00:56.56,Default,,0,0,0,,But I've realized, by watching so long,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:56.58,0:00:59.91,Default,,0,0,0,,that luck is rarely a lightning strike,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:00:59.94,0:01:01.69,Default,,0,0,0,,isolated and dramatic.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:02.24,0:01:04.63,Default,,0,0,0,,It's much more like the wind,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:04.65,0:01:06.22,Default,,0,0,0,,blowing constantly.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:06.24,0:01:07.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes it's calm,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:07.84,0:01:09.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and sometimes it blows in gusts,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:09.96,0:01:14.19,Default,,0,0,0,,and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:14.21,0:01:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So how do you catch the winds of luck?
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:17.61,0:01:20.19,Default,,0,0,0,,It's easy, but it's not obvious.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:20.66,0:01:23.61,Default,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to share three things with you
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:23.63,0:01:28.82,Default,,0,0,0,,that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:29.65,0:01:31.40,Default,,0,0,0,,The first thing you want to do
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:31.43,0:01:33.93,Default,,0,0,0,,is to change your relationship with yourself.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:33.95,0:01:38.07,Default,,0,0,0,,Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:38.09,0:01:41.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:42.45,0:01:45.69,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:45.72,0:01:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,or ride a bike
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:46.90,0:01:48.84,Default,,0,0,0,,or even quantum mechanics. Right?
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:48.87,0:01:51.79,Default,,0,0,0,,We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:51.82,0:01:53.60,Default,,0,0,0,,to, next week, someone who does.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:53.62,0:01:56.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:56.20,0:01:58.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and take some risks.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:01:58.03,0:02:00.15,Default,,0,0,0,,The problem is, as we get older,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:00.17,0:02:02.05,Default,,0,0,0,,we rarely do this.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:02.08,0:02:04.32,Default,,0,0,0,,We sort of lock down the sense of who we are
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:04.35,0:02:06.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and don't stretch anymore.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:06.17,0:02:07.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, with my students,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:07.79,0:02:10.65,Default,,0,0,0,,I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:10.67,0:02:13.18,Default,,0,0,0,,to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:13.78,0:02:14.95,Default,,0,0,0,,How do I do this?
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:14.97,0:02:18.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:18.87,0:02:21.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:21.67,0:02:24.70,Default,,0,0,0,,where they map out what risks they're willing to take.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:24.73,0:02:27.63,Default,,0,0,0,,And it becomes clear very quickly to them
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:27.65,0:02:29.73,Default,,0,0,0,,that risk-taking is not binary.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:30.24,0:02:33.89,Default,,0,0,0,,There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:33.91,0:02:37.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:37.92,0:02:41.71,Default,,0,0,0,,And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:41.73,0:02:45.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and they quickly realize that they're all really different.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:46.00,0:02:48.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I then encourage them to stretch,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:48.58,0:02:51.47,Default,,0,0,0,,to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:51.49,0:02:54.85,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:54.87,0:02:57.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:02:57.96,0:03:02.46,Default,,0,0,0,,or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:02.48,0:03:04.22,Default,,0,0,0,,or an emotional risk,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:04.24,0:03:07.18,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:08.30,0:03:10.75,Default,,0,0,0,,I do this myself all the time.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:11.28,0:03:13.69,Default,,0,0,0,,About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:13.71,0:03:16.47,Default,,0,0,0,,early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:16.50,0:03:22.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And normally, I would just put on my headphones
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:22.24,0:03:24.17,Default,,0,0,0,,and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:24.20,0:03:25.96,Default,,0,0,0,,but I decided to take a little risk,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:25.98,0:03:28.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:28.86,0:03:32.07,Default,,0,0,0,,I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:33.69,0:03:34.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Interesting.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:34.88,0:03:37.12,Default,,0,0,0,,We ended up having a fascinating conversation.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:37.15,0:03:39.94,Default,,0,0,0,,I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:39.96,0:03:43.16,Default,,0,0,0,,So about three quarters of the way through the flight,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:43.18,0:03:44.96,Default,,0,0,0,,I decided to take another risk,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:44.98,0:03:48.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:48.97,0:03:52.94,Default,,0,0,0,,I put together for something I was doing in my class.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:52.97,0:03:54.69,Default,,0,0,0,,And he was very polite, he read it,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:54.72,0:03:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:57.50,0:03:59.17,Default,,0,0,0,,but thank you so much for sharing."
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:03:59.19,0:04:01.23,Default,,0,0,0,,It's OK. That risk didn't work out.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:01.74,0:04:03.02,Default,,0,0,0,,I shut my laptop.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:03.04,0:04:06.04,Default,,0,0,0,,At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:07.59,0:04:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,A couple of months later, I reached out to him,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:10.03,0:04:12.67,Default,,0,0,0,,and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:12.69,0:04:15.45,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:15.47,0:04:16.78,Default,,0,0,0,,the future of publishing."
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:16.80,0:04:18.66,Default,,0,0,0,,And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:18.68,0:04:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,So he came to my class. We had a great experience.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:21.04,0:04:23.14,Default,,0,0,0,,A few months later, I wrote to him again.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:23.17,0:04:25.83,Default,,0,0,0,,This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:25.86,0:04:28.09,Default,,0,0,0,,from another project my students had done.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:28.94,0:04:31.51,Default,,0,0,0,,He was so intrigued
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:31.53,0:04:33.72,Default,,0,0,0,,by one of the projects the students had done,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:33.74,0:04:35.71,Default,,0,0,0,,he thought there might be a book in it,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:35.74,0:04:37.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and he wanted to meet those students.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:38.22,0:04:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:41.45,0:04:44.48,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:44.50,0:04:45.65,Default,,0,0,0,,but OK, it's all right.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:45.68,0:04:49.18,Default,,0,0,0,,So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:49.21,0:04:52.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:53.48,0:04:55.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And one of his editors said to me,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:55.30,0:04:58.10,Default,,0,0,0,,"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:04:58.91,0:05:00.73,Default,,0,0,0,,I said, "Funny you should ask."
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:00.75,0:05:03.85,Default,,0,0,0,,And I pulled out the exact same proposal
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:03.87,0:05:07.24,Default,,0,0,0,,that I had showed his boss a year earlier.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:07.26,0:05:09.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Within two weeks, I had a contract,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:09.71,0:05:13.59,Default,,0,0,0,,and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:16.22,0:05:18.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, you might say,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:18.28,0:05:19.63,Default,,0,0,0,,"Oh, you're so lucky."
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:19.65,0:05:20.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But of course I was lucky,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:20.94,0:05:25.27,Default,,0,0,0,,but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:25.29,0:05:27.56,Default,,0,0,0,,starting with saying hello.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:27.59,0:05:29.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And anyone can do this,

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:31.79,0:05:33.65,Default,,0,0,0,,no matter where you are in the world --

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:36.98,0:05:41.27,Default,,0,0,0,,you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:41.29,0:05:43.62,Default,,0,0,0,,You start building a sail to capture luck.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:44.60,0:05:46.34,Default,,0,0,0,,The second thing you want to do
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:46.37,0:05:49.08,Default,,0,0,0,,is to change your relationship with other people.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:49.10,0:05:54.47,Default,,0,0,0,,You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:54.49,0:05:58.37,Default,,0,0,0,,is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:05:58.40,0:06:01.01,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you don't show appreciation,

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:06:12.95,0:06:15.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:06:16.49,0:06:20.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:06:20.78,0:06:22.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and they are very competitive to get into,

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:08:21.32,0:08:25.21,Default,,0,0,0,,And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:08:26.21,0:08:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:08:55.15,0:08:57.29,Default,,0,0,0,,So I give them a challenge:
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:08:57.31,0:09:00.54,Default,,0,0,0,,to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:09:28.44,0:09:30.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So they hand all the ideas to me,

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:10:00.50,0:10:03.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:10:07.99,0:10:10.30,Default,,0,0,0,,that was going to get thrown out,
Dialogue: Marked=0,0:10:10.32,0:10:12.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:10:14.10,0:10:15.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Pretty cool?

Dialogue: Marked=0,0:10:27.36,0:10:29.29,Default,,0,0,0,,And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?
