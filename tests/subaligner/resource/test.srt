1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,955
I've spent nearly two decades

2
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,532
observing what makes people luckier than others

3
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:22,119
and trying to help people increase their luck.

4
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:25,567
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

5
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:29,140
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

6
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:32,797
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

7
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,136
So what is luck?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,200
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

9
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:43,662
Apparently.

10
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:45,321
That's the operative word.

11
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,362
It looks like it's chance

12
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:53,544
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

13
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,561
But I've realized, by watching so long,

14
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:59,918
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

15
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,696
isolated and dramatic.

16
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,635
It's much more like the wind,

17
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,225
blowing constantly.

18
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,818
Sometimes it's calm,

19
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:09,943
and sometimes it blows in gusts,

20
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:14,192
and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.

21
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:16,689
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

22
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,195
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

23
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:23,615
So I'm going to share three things with you

24
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:28,823
that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.

25
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,406
The first thing you want to do

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,935
is to change your relationship with yourself.

27
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,071
Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

28
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:41,491
Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.

29
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,698
We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk

30
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,880
or ride a bike

31
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:48,848
or even quantum mechanics. Right?

32
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:51,796
We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,603
to, next week, someone who does.

34
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,181
And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone

35
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:58,008
and take some risks.

36
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,151
The problem is, as we get older,

37
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,056
we rarely do this.

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,327
We sort of lock down the sense of who we are

39
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,149
and don't stretch anymore.

40
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,771
Now, with my students,

41
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,651
I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement

42
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:13,183
to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.

43
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:14,952
How do I do this?

44
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,848
Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,652
Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class

46
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,706
where they map out what risks they're willing to take.

47
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,634
And it becomes clear very quickly to them

48
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,734
that risk-taking is not binary.

49
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:33,893
There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks

50
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:37,905
and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.

51
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:41,714
And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,

52
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:45,040
and they quickly realize that they're all really different.

53
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,562
I then encourage them to stretch,

54
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:51,475
to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.

55
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:54,854
For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk

56
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,942
and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;

57
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:02,465
or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;

58
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,220
or an emotional risk,

59
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:07,185
maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.

60
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,751
I do this myself all the time.

61
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,691
About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,

62
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,476
early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,222
And normally, I would just put on my headphones

64
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,177
and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,

65
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,960
but I decided to take a little risk,

66
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:28,842
and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.

67
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:32,073
I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.

68
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:34,856
Interesting.

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,128
We ended up having a fascinating conversation.

70
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,945
I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.

71
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,160
So about three quarters of the way through the flight,

72
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,965
I decided to take another risk,

73
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,949
and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal

74
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:52,949
I put together for something I was doing in my class.

75
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:54,697
And he was very polite, he read it,

76
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,483
and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,

77
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:59,174
but thank you so much for sharing."

78
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,231
It's OK. That risk didn't work out.

79
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:03,021
I shut my laptop.

80
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:06,046
At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.

81
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:10,006
A couple of months later, I reached out to him,

82
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,672
and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?

83
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:15,450
I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,

84
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,783
the future of publishing."

85
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,665
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

86
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,024
So he came to my class. We had a great experience.

87
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,147
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

88
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,837
This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips

89
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:28,099
from another project my students had done.

90
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,514
He was so intrigued

91
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,720
by one of the projects the students had done,

92
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,718
he thought there might be a book in it,

93
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,885
and he wanted to meet those students.

94
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:40,407
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.

96
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:44,481
I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,

97
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:45,656
but OK, it's all right.

98
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,187
So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford

99
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,655
and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.

100
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,283
And one of his editors said to me,

101
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,108
"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"

102
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,735
I said, "Funny you should ask."

103
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,854
And I pulled out the exact same proposal

104
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:07,242
that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

105
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,686
Within two weeks, I had a contract,

106
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,591
and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.

108
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,257
Now, you might say,

109
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,630
"Oh, you're so lucky."

110
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:20,925
But of course I was lucky,

111
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,273
but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,

112
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,567
starting with saying hello.

113
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,980
And anyone can do this,

114
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,767
no matter where you are in your life,

115
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,651
no matter where you are in the world --

116
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,961
even if you think you're the most unlucky person,

117
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:41,274
you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

118
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,627
You start building a sail to capture luck.

119
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,348
The second thing you want to do

120
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:49,081
is to change your relationship with other people.

121
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:54,471
You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey

122
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:58,376
is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,011
And if you don't show appreciation,

124
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,320
not only are you not closing the loop,

125
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:05,082
but you're missing an opportunity.

126
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,424
When someone does something for you,

127
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,710
they're taking that time

128
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,934
that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,

129
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,439
and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.

130
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:20,761
Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,

131
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,882
and they are very competitive to get into,

132
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:26,147
and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,

133
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:29,172
I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.

134
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:32,376
Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,003
Some of them send notes

136
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,475
saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?

137
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,810
And every once in a while,

138
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:42,173
someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,596
This happened about seven years ago.

140
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,349
A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,

141
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,628
"I know I've been rejected from this program twice,

142
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,752
but I want to thank you for the opportunity.

143
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:55,423
I learned so much through the process of applying."

144
00:06:56,205 --> 00:07:00,080
I was so taken by the graciousness of his message

145
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,190
that I invited him to come and meet me.

146
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,001
And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea

147
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,048
for an independent study project together.

148
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,041
He was on the football team at Stanford,

149
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:13,994
and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.

150
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,985
We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,

151
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,414
and he took the project that he started working on

152
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,748
in the independent study

153
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:26,252
and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,

154
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:29,247
where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds

155
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,077
how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.

156
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:35,998
Now, the important thing about this story

157
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,142
is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck

158
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,378
as a result of his thank-you note.

159
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:44,917
But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.

160
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:48,194
Over the course of the last couple of years,

161
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,226
I've come up with some tactics for my own life

162
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,527
to help me really foster appreciation.

163
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,655
My favorite is that at the end of every single day,

164
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:01,425
I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,

165
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,505
and I send thank-you notes to every single person.

166
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,703
It only takes a few minutes,

167
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,506
but at the end of every day,

168
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,799
I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,

169
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,343
and I promise you it has increased my luck.

170
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,806
So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.

171
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,296
Second, you need to show appreciation.

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,216
And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.

173
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,518
Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.

174
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,298
"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."

175
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:35,306
But it's actually much more nuanced.

176
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,878
Ideas are neither good or bad.

177
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:42,708
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.

178
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,238
One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity

179
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:51,324
is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas

180
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:54,503
through the lens of possibilities.

181
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:57,294
So I give them a challenge:

182
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:00,543
to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.

183
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,994
They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant

184
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,587
and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

185
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:10,070
So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop

186
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:11,629
with a beautiful sunset,

187
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,549
or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.

188
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:19,359
And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,

189
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:23,627
or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,

190
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:27,073
or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.

192
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,565
So they hand all the ideas to me,

193
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,832
I read the great ideas out loud,

194
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,921
and then I rip them up and throw them away.

195
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:39,555
I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.

196
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,722
Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,

197
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,563
and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.

198
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,179
Here's what happens.

199
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:55,812
Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."

200
00:09:55,836 --> 00:10:00,478
And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.

201
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:03,789
So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?

202
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:07,973
Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants

203
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,301
that was going to get thrown out,

204
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,905
and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,

205
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,080
with all the leftovers.

206
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,261
Pretty cool?

207
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:18,233
Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?

208
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:22,408
Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground

209
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:26,527
for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.

210
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,298
And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?

211
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,452
It turns into a sushi bar

212
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:34,559
with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.

213
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:39,010
If you look around at the companies,

214
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:42,081
the ventures that are really innovative around you,

215
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:45,731
the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,

216
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,025
well, you know what?

217
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,930
They all started out as crazy ideas.

218
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:52,683
They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,

219
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,834
most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."

220
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:03,863
So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,

221
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,172
and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt

222
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:09,156
that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.

223
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:14,060
But the winds of luck are always there,

224
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:17,139
and if you're willing to take some risks,

225
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:20,671
if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation

226
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:25,116
and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,

227
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,909
through the lens of possibilities,

228
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:31,335
(SOUND EFFECT)

229
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,843
