      <p begin="00:00:14.440" end="00:00:16.955" id="p0">I've spent nearly two decades</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.979" end="00:00:20.532" id="p1">observing what makes people luckier than others</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.556" end="00:00:24.119" id="p2">and trying to help people increase their luck.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.675" end="00:00:27.567" id="p3">You see, I teach entrepreneurship,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.591" end="00:00:31.140" id="p4">and we all know that most new ventures fail,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.164" end="00:00:34.796" id="p5">and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.846" end="00:00:37.136" id="p6">So what is luck?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.160" end="00:00:43.200" id="p7">Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.295" end="00:00:45.662" id="p8">Apparently.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.686" end="00:00:47.321" id="p9">That's the operative word.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.353" end="00:00:50.362" id="p10">It looks like it's chance</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.386" end="00:00:55.544" id="p11">because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.568" end="00:00:58.561" id="p12">But I've realized, by watching so long,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.585" end="00:01:01.918" id="p13">that luck is rarely a lightning strike,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.942" end="00:01:03.696" id="p14">isolated and dramatic.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.249" end="00:01:06.635" id="p15">It's much more like the wind,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:08.224" id="p16">blowing constantly.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.248" end="00:01:09.818" id="p17">Sometimes it's calm,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.842" end="00:01:11.943" id="p18">and sometimes it blows in gusts,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.967" end="00:01:16.192" id="p19">and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.216" end="00:01:18.689" id="p20">So how do you catch the winds of luck?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.616" end="00:01:22.195" id="p21">It's easy, but it's not obvious.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.665" end="00:01:25.615" id="p22">So I'm going to share three things with you</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.639" end="00:01:30.823" id="p23">that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.651" end="00:01:33.406" id="p24">The first thing you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.430" end="00:01:35.935" id="p25">is to change your relationship with yourself.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.959" end="00:01:40.071" id="p26">Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.095" end="00:01:43.491" id="p27">Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.459" end="00:01:47.698" id="p28">We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.722" end="00:01:48.880" id="p29">or ride a bike</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.904" end="00:01:50.848" id="p30">or even quantum mechanics. Right?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.872" end="00:01:53.796" id="p31">We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:55.603" id="p32">to, next week, someone who does.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.627" end="00:01:58.181" id="p33">And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.205" end="00:02:00.008" id="p34">and take some risks.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.032" end="00:02:02.151" id="p35">The problem is, as we get older,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.175" end="00:02:04.056" id="p36">we rarely do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.080" end="00:02:06.327" id="p37">We sort of lock down the sense of who we are</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.351" end="00:02:08.149" id="p38">and don't stretch anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.173" end="00:02:09.771" id="p39">Now, with my students,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.795" end="00:02:12.651" id="p40">I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement</p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.675" end="00:02:15.183" id="p41">to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.787" end="00:02:16.952" id="p42">How do I do this?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.976" end="00:02:20.848" id="p43">Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.872" end="00:02:23.652" id="p44">Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.676" end="00:02:26.706" id="p45">where they map out what risks they're willing to take.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:29.634" id="p46">And it becomes clear very quickly to them</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.658" end="00:02:31.734" id="p47">that risk-taking is not binary.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.242" end="00:02:35.893" id="p48">There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.917" end="00:02:39.905" id="p49">and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.929" end="00:02:43.714" id="p50">And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.738" end="00:02:47.040" id="p51">and they quickly realize that they're all really different.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.006" end="00:02:50.562" id="p52">I then encourage them to stretch,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.586" end="00:02:53.475" id="p53">to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.499" end="00:02:56.854" id="p54">For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.878" end="00:02:59.942" id="p55">and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.966" end="00:03:04.465" id="p56">or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.489" end="00:03:06.220" id="p57">or an emotional risk,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.244" end="00:03:09.185" id="p58">maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.306" end="00:03:12.751" id="p59">I do this myself all the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.286" end="00:03:15.691" id="p60">About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.715" end="00:03:18.476" id="p61">early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.500" end="00:03:24.222" id="p62">And normally, I would just put on my headphones</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.246" end="00:03:26.177" id="p63">and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.201" end="00:03:27.960" id="p64">but I decided to take a little risk,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.984" end="00:03:30.842" id="p65">and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.866" end="00:03:34.073" id="p66">I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.695" end="00:03:36.856" id="p67">Interesting.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.880" end="00:03:39.128" id="p68">We ended up having a fascinating conversation.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.152" end="00:03:41.945" id="p69">I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41.969" end="00:03:45.160" id="p70">So about three quarters of the way through the flight,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.184" end="00:03:46.965" id="p71">I decided to take another risk,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.989" end="00:03:50.949" id="p72">and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.973" end="00:03:54.949" id="p73">I put together for something I was doing in my class.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.973" end="00:03:56.697" id="p74">And he was very polite, he read it,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.721" end="00:03:59.483" id="p75">and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:59.507" end="00:04:01.174" id="p76">but thank you so much for sharing."</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.198" end="00:04:03.231" id="p77">It's OK. That risk didn't work out.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.745" end="00:04:05.021" id="p78">I shut my laptop.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:05.045" end="00:04:08.046" id="p79">At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.594" end="00:04:12.006" id="p80">A couple of months later, I reached out to him,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:14.672" id="p81">and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.696" end="00:04:17.450" id="p82">I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17.474" end="00:04:18.783" id="p83">the future of publishing."</p>
      <p begin="00:04:18.807" end="00:04:20.665" id="p84">And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.689" end="00:04:23.024" id="p85">So he came to my class. We had a great experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:23.048" end="00:04:25.147" id="p86">A few months later, I wrote to him again.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.171" end="00:04:27.837" id="p87">This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.861" end="00:04:30.099" id="p88">from another project my students had done.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.948" end="00:04:33.514" id="p89">He was so intrigued</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.538" end="00:04:35.720" id="p90">by one of the projects the students had done,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.744" end="00:04:37.718" id="p91">he thought there might be a book in it,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37.742" end="00:04:39.885" id="p92">and he wanted to meet those students.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.224" end="00:04:42.407" id="p93">I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.456" end="00:04:46.481" id="p94">I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46.505" end="00:04:47.656" id="p95">but OK, it's all right.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.187" id="p96">So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51.211" end="00:04:54.655" id="p97">and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:55.487" end="00:04:57.283" id="p98">And one of his editors said to me,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.307" end="00:05:00.108" id="p99">"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.918" end="00:05:02.735" id="p100">I said, "Funny you should ask."</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.759" end="00:05:05.854" id="p101">And I pulled out the exact same proposal</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.878" end="00:05:09.242" id="p102">that I had showed his boss a year earlier.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.266" end="00:05:11.686" id="p103">Within two weeks, I had a contract,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.710" end="00:05:15.591" id="p104">and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18.225" end="00:05:20.257" id="p105">Now, you might say,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.281" end="00:05:21.630" id="p106">"Oh, you're so lucky."</p>
      <p begin="00:05:21.654" end="00:05:22.925" id="p107">But of course I was lucky,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:27.273" id="p108">but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:27.297" end="00:05:29.567" id="p109">starting with saying hello.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.591" end="00:05:31.980" id="p110">And anyone can do this,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:32.004" end="00:05:33.767" id="p111">no matter where you are in your life,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.791" end="00:05:35.651" id="p112">no matter where you are in the world --</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.675" end="00:05:38.961" id="p113">even if you think you're the most unlucky person,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.985" end="00:05:43.274" id="p114">you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:43.298" end="00:05:45.627" id="p115">You start building a sail to capture luck.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:46.605" end="00:05:48.348" id="p116">The second thing you want to do</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.372" end="00:05:51.081" id="p117">is to change your relationship with other people.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.105" end="00:05:56.471" id="p118">You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56.495" end="00:06:00.376" id="p119">is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:03.011" id="p120">And if you don't show appreciation,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.035" end="00:06:05.320" id="p121">not only are you not closing the loop,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:05.344" end="00:06:07.082" id="p122">but you're missing an opportunity.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.392" end="00:06:10.424" id="p123">When someone does something for you,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:10.448" end="00:06:11.710" id="p124">they're taking that time</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11.734" end="00:06:14.934" id="p125">that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14.958" end="00:06:17.439" id="p126">and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.492" end="00:06:22.761" id="p127">Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.785" end="00:06:24.882" id="p128">and they are very competitive to get into,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24.906" end="00:06:28.147" id="p129">and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:28.171" end="00:06:31.172" id="p130">I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.196" end="00:06:34.376" id="p131">Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:36.003" id="p132">Some of them send notes</p>
      <p begin="00:06:36.027" end="00:06:39.475" id="p133">saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39.499" end="00:06:40.810" id="p134">And every once in a while,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.834" end="00:06:44.173" id="p135">someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:46.596" id="p136">This happened about seven years ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46.620" end="00:06:49.349" id="p137">A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.373" end="00:06:52.628" id="p138">"I know I've been rejected from this program twice,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.652" end="00:06:54.752" id="p139">but I want to thank you for the opportunity.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54.776" end="00:06:57.423" id="p140">I learned so much through the process of applying."</p>
      <p begin="00:06:58.205" end="00:07:02.080" id="p141">I was so taken by the graciousness of his message</p>
      <p begin="00:07:02.104" end="00:07:04.190" id="p142">that I invited him to come and meet me.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.214" end="00:07:07.001" id="p143">And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.025" end="00:07:09.048" id="p144">for an independent study project together.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:10.072" end="00:07:12.041" id="p145">He was on the football team at Stanford,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.065" end="00:07:15.994" id="p146">and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:16.366" end="00:07:19.985" id="p147">We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20.009" end="00:07:22.414" id="p148">and he took the project that he started working on</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22.438" end="00:07:23.748" id="p149">in the independent study</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.772" end="00:07:28.252" id="p150">and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.276" end="00:07:31.247" id="p151">where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds</p>
      <p begin="00:07:31.271" end="00:07:34.077" id="p152">how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:35.149" end="00:07:37.998" id="p153">Now, the important thing about this story</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38.022" end="00:07:41.142" id="p154">is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41.166" end="00:07:43.378" id="p155">as a result of his thank-you note.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.402" end="00:07:46.917" id="p156">But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48.145" end="00:07:50.194" id="p157">Over the course of the last couple of years,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:50.218" end="00:07:53.226" id="p158">I've come up with some tactics for my own life</p>
      <p begin="00:07:53.250" end="00:07:55.527" id="p159">to help me really foster appreciation.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56.107" end="00:07:59.655" id="p160">My favorite is that at the end of every single day,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:59.679" end="00:08:03.425" id="p161">I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:03.449" end="00:08:06.505" id="p162">and I send thank-you notes to every single person.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.529" end="00:08:08.703" id="p163">It only takes a few minutes,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08.727" end="00:08:10.506" id="p164">but at the end of every day,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:10.530" end="00:08:13.799" id="p165">I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:13.823" end="00:08:16.343" id="p166">and I promise you it has increased my luck.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.207" end="00:08:20.806" id="p167">So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.830" end="00:08:23.296" id="p168">Second, you need to show appreciation.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:23.320" end="00:08:27.216" id="p169">And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:28.210" end="00:08:31.518" id="p170">Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:31.542" end="00:08:34.298" id="p171">"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.322" end="00:08:37.306" id="p172">But it's actually much more nuanced.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.030" end="00:08:39.878" id="p173">Ideas are neither good or bad.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.902" end="00:08:44.707" id="p174">And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:46.039" end="00:08:49.238" id="p175">One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.261" end="00:08:53.323" id="p176">is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas</p>
      <p begin="00:08:53.347" end="00:08:56.503" id="p177">through the lens of possibilities.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:57.157" end="00:08:59.294" id="p178">So I give them a challenge:</p>
      <p begin="00:08:59.318" end="00:09:02.543" id="p179">to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:03.080" end="00:09:05.994" id="p180">They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.018" end="00:09:08.587" id="p181">and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:08.611" end="00:09:12.070" id="p182">So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop</p>
      <p begin="00:09:12.094" end="00:09:13.629" id="p183">with a beautiful sunset,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.653" end="00:09:16.549" id="p184">or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.573" end="00:09:21.359" id="p185">And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21.383" end="00:09:25.627" id="p186">or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:25.651" end="00:09:29.073" id="p187">or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:30.445" end="00:09:32.565" id="p188">So they hand all the ideas to me,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:32.589" end="00:09:34.832" id="p189">I read the great ideas out loud,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34.856" end="00:09:36.921" id="p190">and then I rip them up and throw them away.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.413" end="00:09:41.555" id="p191">I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.159" end="00:09:46.722" id="p192">Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:46.746" end="00:09:49.563" id="p193">and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50.984" end="00:09:52.179" id="p194">Here's what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52.904" end="00:09:57.812" id="p195">Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.836" end="00:10:02.478" id="p196">And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:02.502" end="00:10:05.789" id="p197">So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.813" end="00:10:09.973" id="p198">Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.997" end="00:10:12.301" id="p199">that was going to get thrown out,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:12.325" end="00:10:14.905" id="p200">and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.929" end="00:10:16.080" id="p201">with all the leftovers.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16.104" end="00:10:17.261" id="p202">Pretty cool?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:17.285" end="00:10:20.233" id="p203">Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:20.689" end="00:10:24.408" id="p204">Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.432" end="00:10:28.527" id="p205">for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29.361" end="00:10:31.298" id="p206">And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31.322" end="00:10:33.452" id="p207">It turns into a sushi bar</p>
      <p begin="00:10:33.476" end="00:10:36.559" id="p208">with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37.922" end="00:10:41.010" id="p209">If you look around at the companies,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:41.034" end="00:10:44.081" id="p210">the ventures that are really innovative around you,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:44.105" end="00:10:47.731" id="p211">the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:47.755" end="00:10:49.025" id="p212">well, you know what?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:49.049" end="00:10:51.930" id="p213">They all started out as crazy ideas.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:51.954" end="00:10:54.683" id="p214">They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54.707" end="00:10:57.834" id="p215">most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."</p>
      <p begin="00:11:00.095" end="00:11:05.863" id="p216">So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05.887" end="00:11:08.172" id="p217">and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt</p>
      <p begin="00:11:08.196" end="00:11:11.156" id="p218">that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:12.108" end="00:11:16.060" id="p219">But the winds of luck are always there,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.084" end="00:11:19.139" id="p220">and if you're willing to take some risks,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19.163" end="00:11:22.671" id="p221">if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22.695" end="00:11:27.116" id="p222">and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:27.140" end="00:11:28.909" id="p223">through the lens of possibilities,</p>
